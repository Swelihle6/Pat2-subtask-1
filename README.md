# WHAT IS A MORSE CODE?
Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs. Morse code is named after Samuel Morse, one of the early developers of the system adopted for electrical telegraphy

# HISTORICAL TEXT OF WHY MORSE CODE WAS CREATED  
Morse code was developed so that operators could translate the indentations marked on the paper tape into text messages
Morse developed a code that assigned a set of dots and dashes to each letter of the English alphabet, allowing for simple transmission of complex messages across telegraph lines.
